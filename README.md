BIO: Outside of attending STECH I'm working a part time job where I have a scholarship for STECH, and some of my hobbies are gaming, reading, drawing, and coding.

I'm taking this course to start a career in software development where I can learn how all of the other fields work, but with my end goal being a senior developer in game development.
